# CVE Analysis Dashboard

This project aims to provide insights into the landscape of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) through interactive data visualizations. The dashboard leverages the CVE dataset from [source of the dataset] to uncover trends, risks, and areas for improvement in cybersecurity practices.

## Features

* **CVE Trend Over Time:** Visualizes the number of CVEs published each year, revealing trends and potential spikes in vulnerability disclosures.
* **CVSS Score Distribution:** Displays the distribution of CVSS scores, helping understand the severity of vulnerabilities.
* **Top CWE Names:** Showcases the most common CWE names, highlighting prevalent types of weaknesses.
* **Top Vendors:** Identifies the vendors with the highest number of associated CVEs, indicating potential vendor risk.
* **Top Products:** Presents the products most affected by vulnerabilities, assisting in prioritizing patching and security measures.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the CVE dataset from [source of the dataset]. This dataset contains information about CVEs, including their publication dates, severity scores (CVSS), associated weaknesses (CWEs), and the affected vendors and products.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Used for data analysis and visualization.
* **Pandas:** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Altair:** A declarative visualization library for creating interactive charts.

Visualizations
The project generates the following visualizations:

cve_trend_over_time.json
cvss_score_distribution.json
top_cwe_names.json
top_vendors.json
top_products.json
You can view these interactive visualizations using a tool like the Altair Viewer.

Future Enhancements
Interactive Dashboard: Integrate the visualizations into a single, interactive dashboard using a framework like Streamlit or Dash.
Real-time Data: Incorporate real-time CVE data feeds to keep the dashboard up-to-date.
Predictive Analytics: Explore machine learning models to predict future CVE trends or identify high-risk vulnerabilities.
User Customization: Allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their specific interests.
